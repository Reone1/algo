# Binary Recursion
'S' is a binary string, e.g. '1001', '0010'.

1. remove all zeros from `S`. 
2. convert the length of `S` to a binary string.
3. `S` ends the logic with `'1'`.

The output is an array with  `cntZero` and `times`
`cntZero` is the number of zeros removed
`times` is times the length of s was converted to a binary string.
## input
BinaryString (s) : `string`

## output
cntZero : `number`
times : `number`

output `[cntZero, times]` : `Array<number>`

## option
nothing
